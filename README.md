Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)
Overview:
The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a web-based healthcare application developed in C# with a MySQL database backend. It is designed to enhance the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery by assisting medical professionals with accurate, timely, and data-driven clinical decisions. The system integrates patient data, symptom tracking, diagnosis support, treatment recommendations, and appointment scheduling in a single platform.
